# Azure-POC

Hi,

The Book-Shop and Book-Supplier, in this Azure-POC respository, are 2 java projects (employing Spring MVC), developed to be deployed as Azure WebApp to show case 



	1. Use of Azure Blob Storage, where-in, uploaded documents/ pictures (instead of a BLOB in a RDBMS) can be stored.
	2. Use of Azure Service bus, to communicate between 2 applications

thanks
